The tel-o-fun website's placement of stations is probably less accurate than that of OpenStreetMap.  This process somewhat automates the correcting of the coordinates.

First run:

./get_telofun_stations.pl > telofun_stations.csv

The output is rows of station_id,latitude,longitude.

Next run:

./get_OSM_nodes.pl > OSM_nodes.csv

The output is rows of OSM_node_id,latitude,longitude.

Are either of those new?  If not, there's no point in continuing.  Check that:

diff telofun_stations.csv Results | less
diff OSM_nodes.csv Results | less

Assuming you want to go on, now run:

./match_OSM_telofun.pl > match_OSM_telofun.csv

It assumes that you have the previous two outputs in the current directory.  The output is rows of distance,OSM_node_id,station_id.

Inspect match_OSM_telofun.csv visually. Find the cut-off where nodes in telofun aren't yet mapped by OSM cartographers.  Currently there is a big gap between 88m and 787m.  Delete the rows beyond that gap and save the new file as match_OSM_telofun_valid.csv :

cp match_OSM_telofun.csv match_OSM_telofun_valid.csv
emacs match_OSM_telofun_valid.csv

Now run:

./fix_telofun_stations.pl < match_OSM_telofun_valid.csv > telofun_stations_fixed.csv

It assumes that you have telofun_stations.csv and match_OSM_telofun.csv in the current directory.  The output is rows of telofun_stations.csv with latitutudes and longitudes replaced with the results from OSM for the validated rows.

Now get the distances using the new, telofun_stations_fixed.csv file:

./get_distances.pl < telofun_stations_fixed.csv > distances.csv

It will take some time, around 9 minutes.  It's done when the second is equal to the square of the first (such as 83*83=6889):

wc telofun_stations_fixed.csv distances.csv

In some cases, we can find the distance one way but not in reverse.  Strange!  So for all unknown distances, use the reverse distance if possible:

./reverse_distances.pl < distances.csv > reverse_distances.csv

Now there are still some distances that we don't know.  We'll just use Google to figure them out quickly:

./google_unknown_distances.pl < reverse_distances.csv

Run those one-by-one and enter the results into a new file:

cp reverse_distances.csv reverse_distances_plus_manual.csv
emacs reverse_distances_plus_manual.csv

Now make the distances javascript file:

./distances2js.pl < reverse_distances_plus_manual.csv > distances.js

Now make the stations javascript file:

./stations2js.pl < telofun_stations_fixed.csv > stations.js
